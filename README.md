#Playing around with git and prepping for git bisect
Nothing spectacular here.  Bunch of branches and commits.

Documentation:  [git bisect](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect) and [debugging with git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Debugging-with-Git)

Git bisesct uses a binary search to allow the developer to identify the bad commit.
